ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Vishvaraj** (with a *V* before H)!

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ve contributed to open-source at **Magico**, helping build a **Museum Ticketing Website**.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve also contributed to **@ACES-RMDSSOE** by developing a [custom link shortener](https://github.com/ACES-RMDSSOE/share) for our official website.

ðŸ¤– Currently exploring the intersection of **AI & Web Development** by building **AI wrappers** using modern development stacks and cutting-edge models.

âš¡ *Fun Fact:* AI canâ€™t replace me â€” it just makes me faster.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build good tech with good purpose
